                        <p>It was a day unlike any other, the day I realized,if I was gonna live a good life I better start looking at my lifestyle. No more excuses, no more turning a blind eye. It was a couple weeks after my Mother had passed, and because
                            of what she went through I was thouroghly done with Western Medicine. Up till that day, I was still hanging on to the hopes that it hadn't completely failed us. That particular day it hit me like a mac truck on a cold and rainy
                            night, I was done, I may have just been minced meat scattered all over the road. My brain was everywhere! I started researching, and to my complete and utter disastisfaction I realized its not just western medicine that had
                            failed us, it was all the companies I had relied on for years. I literally was going to have to go in to every room in my house and throw all the poisonous products away! I was about to just throw in the towel and say, "fuck
                            it we have to die from something", but that day I had a special kind of strength. I realized I was going to have to revert to the ancients. The ones who came before us, the ones who lived way before plastic and synthetic medicine
                            wrecked us and our planet. The ones who lived by the sun and slept by the moon, who grew their own food and made their own medicine. I was going to have to somehow get in touch with my genetic code and try to remember the knowledge
                            that was already written in to my being. So it began, my quest to write out all commercial products and become self sustaining! </p>

                        <h2>It's all about health/wellness</h2>
                        <h5>Title description, June 23, 2019</h5>
                        <div>

                        <p>
                            There are so many reasons to switch to a more organic way of living. Do you know them? At one time in my 43 years, I did not. It took someone I love to get sick for the reality to slap me in the face! So, do not feel bad if you aren't aware. I will help
                            you. I'm just gonna concentrate on one of the reasons in this blog and continue 2, 3, 4, etc as time moves forward. Reason 1: Your Health! Why do we continue to purchase products from companies we know use toxic chemicals?
                            I'll tell you why. It's cheaper! The reason its cheaper is because of the toxic chemicals. These companies are literally creating poisons just to place a huge gap between real products and fake products when it comes to the
                            market place. Why you ask? So you, the consumer, will think you are getting a deal. Yes you are getting a deal when it comes to your wallet, but when it comes to your health, the raw deal is the only one you are getting. My
                            philosophy on this: You are either gonna pay for your health now with organic products to keep you from getting sick, or you are gonna pay later when you actually are sick. Have you seen the hospital bills cancer patients are
                            receiving? I'd much rather pay a little extra now than thousands later. It is our duty as humans to take back our health and stop investing in these criminal companies. Corporate companies, who do not care about your health
                            in the long run, are only interested in the bottom dollar. </p>
