                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Elder Apothecary. We are so glad you are here. We want to help you on your journey to health and wellness. We understand that you can be anywhere from a beginner to an expert in herbal health and wellness and we will do everything
                    in our power to make you a happy returning customer. <br><strong>About the Founder of Elder Apothecary:</strong> <br> Ever since I was a child I had a vision that I was a healer, and as time went on I realized I was just that. What
                    I learned along the way is we are all healers, we just have to learn how to use our gifts. As a society we have been pushed so far from our roots as a species that we are willing to take medicine that basically advertises that it is
                    Anti-Biological being. let me explain what I mean.<br>
                    <Strong>Herbal medicine:</Strong><br>Oregano oil-<br>Anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal.<br><strong>Western medicine:</strong><br> Amoxicillin- <br>Antibiotic <br><strong> Why I decided to switch:</strong> <br>In 2003 my mother was diagnosed with terminal
                    ovarian cancer. It was shocking to my family, because you know the way we think, "that couldn't happen to us", well it did and it was close to home. I decided to quit my job as a hair stylist and devote my days to taking care of her
                    along side my father. It was tremendously painful watching her die slowly, knowing if she would have made better choices in her diet she wouldn't be in this situation. Day after day, week after week I sat by her bedside giving her
                    positive thoughts and lots of love hoping that would make a difference, waiting for her to fall asleep to cry.  She had multiple surgeries and because of the chemo nothing would heal, so not only was my mother in tremendous pain, she
                    also had large open wounds I would have to pack each day. As you can imagine I was devastated. I was even more devastated when she lost her battle on April 24th 2004. On her death bed she asked me to go to school, so I did. I was going
                    to go for something in the medical industry. I started thinking I was going to want to do this, but as I progressed I kept being nagged by this sick gut feeling that I didn't want to have anything to do with western medicine. I knew
                    it was just a hoaks to create customers, so why would I want anything to do with that?  I ended up changing my major to Mortuary Sciences. Yes, thats correct, what you just read isn't a typo. I became a Mortician. All the while I had
                    been researching our Original Medicine that was used from the beginning of time till about 200 years ago when the medicine we now use (well some of us use) was the only thing we had.<br>
                    <Strong>Fast forward to today</Strong><br> I decided to create this website to help apothecaries and people come back to thier roots and find the balance in life as well as the healer within each and everyone of us.
